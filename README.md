## üìñ Purpose: 

The primary purpose of this project is to learn about and have fun while creating a chatbot. 
But the hope is that the final product will be a function (and practical) addition to any GroupMe groupchat.

## üóí Features:
- Using keywords in the chat messages, the bots recognize requests for the following information:
	- A joke.
	- A (motivational) quote.
	- An analysis of the groupchat messages.
	- The verse of the day.
	- The weather forecast.
	- This day in history.
	- Today's state and national holidays.
	- Today's top news--with an additional feature allowing many news catagories.
- All of the above features can be turned off individually.
- All of the above features also have an server endpoint attached to them, which any machine can ping to activate their respective functions.

## üî® Installation: 

*IMPORTANT: THIS GUIDE IS INCORRECT. It will soon be replaced, but if you would still like to try it, you need to sign up for all the APIs and add the enviroment variables in the Heroku setup.*

This is the recommended and tested setup, feel free to switch out server hosting providers, for example. Feel free to ask questions!

The following guide is only for those who know how to navigate their computer well; a better guide will come out soon.
+ Step 1: Install Git from here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
+ Step 2: Install Heroku CLI from here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.
+ Step 3: Go to heroku.com and signup (or log in).
+ Step 4: Click "New" in the top left corner, click "Create new app."
+ Step 5: Go to https://github.com/Strat5/gmechatbot, and click "Clone or download," then "Download ZIP."
+ Step 6: In your downloads, folder unzip the gmechatbot-master file, and move the file to your preferred directory.
+ Step 7: Inside the gmechatbot-master folder, open the server_application folder, and then open config.py. You can change what keywords in the chat messages the bots will respond to or ignore. 
+ Step 8: Open cmd if you are in Windows, or terminal on MacOS or Linux.
+ Step 9: Navigate using the cd command to the gmechatbot-master file.
+ Step 10: Enter the following commands
	- "heroku login"
		- You will need to provide your heroku account login details.
	- cd server_application
	- git init .
	- heroku git:remote -a {name of your heroku app here... without the curly braces}
	- git add -A
	- git commit 
	- git push heroku master
+ Step 11: Go to dev.groupme.com and log in with your GroupMe account.
	- You will need to provide a verification code that will be texted or emailed to you.
+ Step 12: Click "Bots" at the top of the screen.
+ Step 13: Click the orange "Create Bot" button.
+ Step 14: Select the groupchat you want to the bot to live in, fill in the name of bot #1, the callback url with this: "https://{name of your heroku app here... without the curly braces}.herokuapp.com/", and then click "Submit."
+ Step 15: Repeat steps 12 and 13 but with a different name for the second bot, and don't include a callback url.
+ Step 16: Test it in GroupMe! If it doesn't work, try to see if you missed a step. If you can't figure it out, ask a question in Github.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage: 

The Talker (one of two chatbots) will recieve the messages and recognize the following keywords in any message:
- 'joke'
- 'quote'
- 'analyze'
- 'verse'
- 'weather'
- 'history'
- 'news'
- 'holiday'

If the desired function has something to do with research (weather, history, news, etc) then the Digital Journalist bot will send the reply instead of The Talker. 

For those who know what they are doing, try setting up cron--or some other alternative--on a server to automatically ping the provided endpoints on a schedule. The endpoints are identitical to the keywords; for example, 00 12 * * * curl -X POST https://my-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com/joke would equate to a joke being posted in the groupchat every noon.
