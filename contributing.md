- Please use commenting to help others understand your code more quickly.
- Please make sure the commenting is short, but informative.
- Do not add any material that would only be appropiate for a higher age group.
- Only add or work on features that are in the official to-do list on Github. 

Note: The master branch on this repositiory auto deploys to Github, please do not submit a pull request from a fork with an incomplete feature.
