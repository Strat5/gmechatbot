## 📖 Purpose: 

The primary purpose of this project is to learn together. 
But the hope is that the final product will be a function (and practical) addition to any groupchat.

## 🗒 Features:
	
- A working chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to talk to users.
- A seperate bot that can post to the chat daily information including:
	- The verse of the day.
	- The weather forecast.
	- Today's day in history.
	- Today's top news.

## 🔨 Installation: 

Installation guide coming soon.

Note: The bot is designed to be ran on Heroku with a gunicorn setup.
